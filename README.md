### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michela! 

I'm a data analyst and I'm currently learning from DeepLearningAI and Codecademy digital platforms how to become a Python developer. Here I give you an overview of my open source stuff. 

I'm looking to collaborate on Python projects. 

You can also find me on Linkedin.
