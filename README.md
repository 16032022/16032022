### Hi there 👋

I am Michela! 

Here, you can find an overview of my past open-source projects I have developed in collaboration with AI professionals across the 
[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) 
digital platforms, focused on building up AI applications using Python. Ongoing and current work can be found at: [Github](https://github.com/micag2025).

I look forward to collaborating with AI professionals on real-world projects that leverage Python and AI technologies.

You can also contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michela-agostini-627546a7/).
